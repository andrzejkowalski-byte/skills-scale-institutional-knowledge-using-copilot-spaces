# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes, templates, checklists, and role guidance. Use these docs as the single source of truth when initiating, planning, executing, releasing, and reflecting on cross-functional projects.

## Brief overview of our project management approach
OctoAcme follows a lightweight, evidence-driven lifecycle that balances speed and risk control:

- Initiation: Validate ideas, align stakeholders, and capture the business case and success metrics in a Project One-pager.
- Planning: Break approved initiatives into shippable increments, estimate effort, identify dependencies and risks, and agree on milestones and the Definition of Done.
- Execution & Tracking: Use project boards and PR workflows; iterate in short increments with CI, testing, and regular demos. Track velocity, blocked work, and key success metrics.
- Risk Management & Communication: Maintain a risk register, proactively mitigate issues, and keep stakeholders updated with a single source of truth.
- Release & Deployment: Follow pre-release checks, deployment checklists, rollback plans, and post-deploy verifications.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement: Run blameless retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents and convert learnings into tracked action items.
- Roles & Personas: Clear role definitions (PM, PdM, Developers, QA, Stakeholders) help set expectations and streamline handoffs.

Principles: customer-first, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

This README is intentionally concise — each linked file contains detailed guidance and checklists for the corresponding phase. If you'd like sections expanded (e.g., templates inline, sample one-pagers, or automated checks to run), I can add them in follow-up PRs.
