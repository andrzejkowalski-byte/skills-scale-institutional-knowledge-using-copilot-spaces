# UX Research & Designer Handoff Guidelines

Purpose:
- Provide a lightweight, repeatable guide for planning, running, and handing off UX work so engineering and product can implement with minimal rework.

When to use:
- Before design-heavy features, A/B tests, or UI refactors.

Sections:
1. Research & validation checklist
   - Define research question and success criteria
   - Recruit participants representative of target users
   - Timebox research and synthesis
   - Produce 3–5 actionable insights

2. Deliverables for handoff
   - Annotated wireframes or high-fidelity mockups
   - Clickable prototype (if interaction is significant)
   - Accessibility notes and known constraints
   - Acceptance criteria tied to observable behaviors

3. Handoff process
   - Walkthrough with Product and Dev (30–60 mins)
   - Share a short implementation guidance doc with examples and edge cases
   - Add UX acceptance criteria to backlog items

4. Post-release validation
   - Coordinate with Data Analyst to instrument key events
   - Run usability sanity checks on staging and production
